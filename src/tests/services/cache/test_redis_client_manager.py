"""
Test module for RedisClientManager.

This module contains unit tests for the RedisClientManager class,
which provides shared Redis client architecture for efficient connection
management across multiple cache instances.

Test coverage includes:
- Redis client pool management
- Connection lifecycle (creation, reuse, cleanup)
- Synchronous and asynchronous Redis client support
- Connection retry and error handling
- Thread-safety for multi-cache scenarios
- Resource optimization and cleanup
