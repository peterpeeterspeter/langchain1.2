Cache Factory Module.

This module provides factory classes and functions for creating different types of
cache instances. It supports creating specialized RedisSemanticCache instances
with content-type specific configurations, TTL strategies, and connection parameters.

The factory pattern allows for flexible cache creation and configuration management
while maintaining consistency across different cache types used in the casino
review system.
