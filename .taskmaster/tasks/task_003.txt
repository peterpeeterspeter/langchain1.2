# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Contextual Retrieval System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build advanced retrieval with contextual embedding and hybrid search capabilities, integrating with the completed enhanced confidence scoring system
# Details:
Implement contextual retrieval (prepend context to chunks before embedding), hybrid search (dense + BM25), multi-query retrieval, self-query retrieval with metadata filtering, maximal marginal relevance for diverse results.
