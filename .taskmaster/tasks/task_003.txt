# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Contextual Retrieval System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build advanced retrieval with contextual embedding and hybrid search capabilities, integrating with the completed enhanced confidence scoring system
# Details:
Implement contextual retrieval (prepend context to chunks before embedding), hybrid search (dense + BM25), multi-query retrieval, self-query retrieval with metadata filtering, maximal marginal relevance for diverse results. Integration must work seamlessly with the completed Task 2.3 enhanced confidence scoring system, including query classification accuracy bonuses, expertise level matching, and enhanced source metadata with visual indicators.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark against baseline retrieval, measure precision@5 (target >0.8), test query diversity, validate metadata filtering. Verify integration with completed Task 2.3 confidence scoring system - test that retrieved sources properly flow through enhanced metadata generation, query classification bonuses are applied correctly, and dynamic TTL caching works with new retrieval methods.
