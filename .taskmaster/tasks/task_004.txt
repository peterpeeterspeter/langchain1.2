# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Content Processing Pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build FTI Feature Pipeline for content ingestion and processing
# Details:
Implement content type detection, adaptive chunking strategies, metadata extraction, progressive enhancement, document processing for diverse content types (articles, reviews, technical docs).

# Test Strategy:
Test content type detection accuracy, validate chunking strategies, verify metadata extraction, measure processing throughput

# Subtasks:
## 1. Fix Import Dependencies and Create Missing Components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Resolve all import errors and create missing foundational components required for the FTI pipeline
### Details:
Create missing modules: content_processor.py, chunking_strategies.py, metadata_extractor.py, progressive_enhancer.py. Fix import statements in existing files. Implement base classes and interfaces for content processing components. Ensure proper module structure and circular dependency resolution.

## 2. Implement Content Type Detection System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Build intelligent content type detection and classification system for diverse document formats
### Details:
Implement MIME type detection, file extension analysis, content signature validation, and heuristic-based classification. Support articles, reviews, technical docs, PDFs, HTML, markdown, and plain text. Create ContentTypeDetector class with confidence scoring and fallback mechanisms.

## 3. Develop Adaptive Chunking Strategies [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create intelligent chunking system that adapts to different content types and structures
### Details:
Implement multiple chunking strategies: semantic chunking for articles, section-based chunking for technical docs, paragraph-based for reviews. Create ChunkingStrategy interface with implementations for FixedSizeChunker, SemanticChunker, and StructuralChunker. Include overlap handling and chunk size optimization.

## 4. Build Metadata Extraction Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive metadata extraction for enhanced content understanding and retrieval
### Details:
Extract title, author, creation date, keywords, summary, content structure, language detection, and domain-specific metadata. Implement MetadataExtractor with pluggable extractors for different content types. Include confidence scoring and metadata validation.

## 5. Create Progressive Enhancement System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Implement progressive content enhancement with embeddings, entity recognition, and semantic analysis
### Details:
Build ProgressiveEnhancer that adds embeddings generation, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Implement enhancement pipeline with configurable stages and caching. Integrate with existing embedding models and NLP tools.

## 6. Integrate Feature and Training Pipelines [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5
### Description: Combine all components into cohesive feature processing and model training pipelines
### Details:
Create FeaturePipeline orchestrating content detection, chunking, metadata extraction, and enhancement. Implement TrainingPipeline for model fine-tuning with processed features. Add pipeline configuration, error handling, monitoring, and batch processing capabilities.

## 7. Implement Database Migrations and Inference Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 4.6
### Description: Create database schema updates and production-ready inference pipeline with comprehensive testing
### Details:
Design and implement database migrations for storing processed content, metadata, and embeddings. Create InferencePipeline for real-time content processing and retrieval. Add API endpoints, caching layer, and monitoring. Implement comprehensive test suite covering unit, integration, and performance tests.
