# Task ID: 10
# Title: Setup Comprehensive Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing with performance benchmarks
# Details:
Create test suites for each component, implement performance benchmarking, set up automated quality metrics (precision@5, response relevance, hallucination detection), continuous monitoring systems.

# Test Strategy:
Achieve >0.8 retrieval precision@5, >0.85 response relevance, <5% hallucination rate, comprehensive test coverage
