# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Supabase Foundation Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish core Supabase project with PostgreSQL database, pgvector extension, authentication, storage, and edge functions
# Details:
Create Supabase project, configure database schema (content_items, content_embeddings, media_assets, rag_query_cache tables), enable pgvector extension, set up RLS policies, configure authentication and storage buckets. This foundational layer supports all other components.

# Test Strategy:
Verify database connections, test vector operations, validate RLS policies, confirm storage functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure PostgreSQL Database Schema [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the database schema for content_items, content_embeddings, media_assets, and rag_query_cache tables
### Details:
Use the existing schema design from the legacy codebase. Create tables for content_items (id, title, content, metadata), content_embeddings (id, content_id, embedding), media_assets (id, content_id, url, type), and rag_query_cache (id, query, result, timestamp).
<info added on 2025-06-12T12:10:51.547Z>
Database Schema Setup Complete - Verified Existing Infrastructure: Core tables already exist (content_items, content_embeddings, media_assets, rag_query_cache), Vector extension (v0.8.0) already installed and functional, UUID-OSSP extension (v1.1) available, Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on core tables. Applied Additional Components: RLS policies for content security (public/private content access), Vector similarity search function: search_similar_content(), Semantic cache lookup function: search_similar_queries(), Cache cleanup function: clean_expired_cache(), Auto-update timestamp trigger for content_items. Database Schema Ready: Content items with vector embeddings support, Semantic caching with 1536-dimension embeddings, Media asset management with WordPress integration, Full-text search indexes on content, Performance-optimized vector indexes (IVFFlat). Key Functions Available: search_similar_content() - Main RAG search functionality, search_similar_queries() - Cache lookup for performance, clean_expired_cache() - Maintenance function. The database foundation is now production-ready for the Universal RAG CMS system.

## 2. Enable and Configure pgvector Extension [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Enable the pgvector extension in the Supabase project for vector similarity search
### Details:
Enable pgvector extension using Supabase dashboard or SQL command. Create necessary indexes on the embedding column in the content_embeddings table for efficient similarity search.

**pgvector Extension Verified and Functional**

Extension Status:
- pgvector v0.8.0 already installed and active
- Vector data type available in database schema
- All vector operators working correctly:
  - Cosine distance (<->) 
  - Negative inner product (<#>)
  - L2/Euclidean distance (<=>)

Database Schema Verification:
- content_embeddings table with vector(1536) column ready
- rag_query_cache table with query_embedding vector(1536) ready  
- Vector operations tested and performing correctly

Performance Ready:
- Vector similarity search functions operational
- 1536-dimension embeddings supported (OpenAI standard)
- All three distance metrics available for different use cases
- Ready for high-performance semantic search

## 3. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) Policies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up RLS policies for all tables to ensure proper access control
### Details:
Create RLS policies for content_items, content_embeddings, media_assets, and rag_query_cache tables. Implement policies for insert, select, update, and delete operations based on user roles and authentication status.
<info added on 2025-06-12T12:17:44.704Z>
Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation Complete

Security Policies Implemented:

Content Items:
- Public content readable by everyone (status='published')
- Users can view/edit their own content (author_id matching)
- Service role has full access for system operations
- Users can insert content with proper author attribution

Content Embeddings:
- Embeddings follow content access rules (published or owned)
- Users can manage embeddings for their own content
- Service role access for vector operations

Media Assets:
- Media follows content visibility rules
- Service role can manage all media for uploads/processing

RAG Query Cache:
- Accessible to authenticated users and service role
- Proper caching security for query performance

Security Cleanup:
- Removed overly permissive "read all" policies
- All core CMS tables have RLS enabled
- Proper role-based access control implemented
- Service role access for system operations maintained

Security Model: Public content is accessible to all, private content only to owners, service role has system-wide access for processing.

## 4. Configure Authentication Settings [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up authentication providers and user management in Supabase
### Details:
Enable email/password authentication, configure OAuth providers if required. Set up email templates for verification and password reset. Create initial admin user account.
