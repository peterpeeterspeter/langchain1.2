## Confidence Scoring System

### 4-Factor Analysis

The system uses a sophisticated 4-factor weighted scoring approach:

#### 1. Content Quality (35% weight)
- **Completeness**: How thoroughly the response addresses the query
- **Relevance**: How well the content matches the user's intent
- **Accuracy Indicators**: Presence of factual, verifiable information
- **Clarity**: How well-structured and understandable the response is

#### 2. Source Quality (25% weight)
- **Reliability**: Quality and authority of source documents
- **Coverage**: Breadth and depth of source material
- **Consistency**: Agreement between multiple sources
- **Verification**: Extent of source verification and validation

#### 3. Query Matching (20% weight)
- **Intent Alignment**: How well the response matches user intent
- **Expertise Match**: Appropriateness for user's knowledge level
- **Format Appropriateness**: Correct response format for query type
- **Keyword Relevance**: Presence of relevant terms and concepts

#### 4. Technical Factors (20% weight)
- **Retrieval Quality**: Quality of document retrieval process
- **Generation Stability**: Consistency of LLM generation
- **Optimization Effectiveness**: Success of prompt optimization
- **System Performance**: Response time and resource efficiency

### Query-Type Specific Weights

The system adjusts weights based on query type for optimal relevance:

```python
QUERY_TYPE_WEIGHTS = {
    'factual': {
        'content_quality': 0.40,    # Emphasize accuracy
        'source_quality': 0.30,    # Trust sources
        'query_matching': 0.20,
        'technical_factors': 0.10
    },
    'tutorial': {
        'content_quality': 0.45,    # Emphasize clarity
        'source_quality': 0.20,    
        'query_matching': 0.25,    # Match learning style
        'technical_factors': 0.10
    },
    'comparison': {
        'content_quality': 0.35,
        'source_quality': 0.30,    # Need multiple sources
        'query_matching': 0.25,    # Match comparison criteria
        'technical_factors': 0.10
    },
    'review': {
        'content_quality': 0.30,
        'source_quality': 0.35,    # Expertise matters most
        'query_matching': 0.25,
        'technical_factors': 0.10
    }
}
```
