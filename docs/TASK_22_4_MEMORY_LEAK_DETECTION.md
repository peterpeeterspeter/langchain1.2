## 📊 Memory Leak Detection Algorithm

### Statistical Analysis

The framework uses advanced statistical methods to detect memory leaks:

1. **Linear Regression Analysis**
   - Calculates memory growth rate (MB/second)
   - Determines correlation coefficient for trend strength
   - Identifies sustained memory growth patterns

2. **Leak Severity Classification**
   ```python
   if slope > 0.1 and correlation > 0.8:
       severity = "critical"
   elif slope > 0.1 and correlation > 0.6:
       severity = "moderate"
   elif slope > 0.1 and correlation > 0.4:
       severity = "minor"
   else:
       severity = "none"
   ```

3. **Memory Trend Analysis**
   - Initial vs final memory usage comparison
   - Peak memory detection
   - Average memory usage calculation
   - Growth rate analysis over time

```

## 🚀 Production Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from test_task_22_4_memory_leak_detection import MemoryLeakDetector

# Initialize detector
detector = MemoryLeakDetector(
    sample_interval=0.5,
    alert_threshold_mb=1024.0
)

# Run extended memory test
results = await detector.run_extended_memory_test(
    duration_minutes=60,
    operations_per_minute=10
)

# Check results
if results["overall_success"]:
    print("✅ No memory leaks detected")
else:
    print("❌ Memory issues found")
```

### Production Runner
```python
# Run comprehensive production tests
python tests/memory_leak_production_runner.py
```

The production runner executes multiple test scenarios:
- **Quick Stability Test**: 2 minutes, 30 operations/minute
- **Medium Load Test**: 5 minutes, 20 operations/minute  
- **Extended Endurance Test**: 10 minutes, 15 operations/minute

### CI/CD Integration

The framework provides exit codes for automated pipeline integration:
- `0`: All tests passed, no issues detected
- `1`: Critical issues found (memory leaks, test failures)
- `2`: Warnings found (cleanup issues)
- `3`: Test runner error

```yaml
# Example CI/CD configuration
- name: Memory Leak Detection
  run: python tests/memory_leak_production_runner.py
  continue-on-error: false
```

## 📈 Monitoring and Alerting

### Memory Thresholds

**Recommended Production Thresholds:**
- Memory growth rate > 0.1 MB/sec: Warning alert
- Memory growth rate > 0.5 MB/sec: Critical alert
- Browser process orphaned > 30 seconds: Process leak alert
- Temp files not cleaned > 60 seconds: File leak alert

### Alert Configuration
```python
detector = MemoryLeakDetector(
    sample_interval=0.5,        # Sample every 500ms
    alert_threshold_mb=2048.0   # Alert at 2GB usage
)
```

### Logging Configuration
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(),
        logging.FileHandler('memory_leak_detection.log')
    ]
)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High Memory Usage
```python
# Check for memory leaks
if memory_trend["leak_severity"] in ["moderate", "critical"]:
    # Implement browser recycling
    # Increase garbage collection frequency
    # Review DOM reference cleanup
```

#### Orphaned Processes
```python
# Check for process cleanup issues
if not cleanup_verification["cleanup_successful"]:
    # Review browser termination procedures
    # Implement timeout mechanisms
    # Add process monitoring alerts
```

#### Test Failures
```python
# Check test configuration
if operations_failed > 0:
    # Review screenshot service stability
    # Check network connectivity
    # Verify browser initialization
```
