- Security header checks
- SSL/TLS validation
- Load testing (basic)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```yaml
# Default Python version
PYTHON_VERSION: '3.11'

# Coverage threshold (percentage)
COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: '80'

# Performance regression threshold (percentage)
REGRESSION_THRESHOLD: '10'

# Test suite selection
TEST_SUITE: 'all'  # Options: all, unit, integration, performance, security
```

### Secrets Required

```yaml
# Test API keys (for integration tests)
TEST_OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-..."
TEST_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "sk-ant-..."
TEST_SUPABASE_URL: "https://..."
TEST_SUPABASE_KEY: "eyJ..."

# Deployment validation
DEPLOYMENT_API_KEY: "..."
MONITORING_WEBHOOK: "https://..."

# GitHub token (for badge updates)
GITHUB_TOKEN: "ghp_..."
```

## Test Markers

The pipeline uses pytest markers to categorize tests:

```python
@pytest.mark.unit
def test_unit_functionality():
    """Unit test - fast, isolated"""
    pass

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_integration_workflow():
    """Integration test - with external services"""
    pass

@pytest.mark.performance
def test_performance_benchmark():
    """Performance test - with benchmarking"""
    pass

@pytest.mark.security
def test_security_validation():
    """Security test - authentication, authorization"""
    pass

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_slow_operation():
    """Slow test - may take several minutes"""
    pass

@pytest.mark.smoke
def test_basic_functionality():
    """Smoke test - basic functionality validation"""
    pass
```

## Deployment Gates

### Criteria for Deployment Approval

‚úÖ **Required for Deployment:**
- Unit tests pass on all Python versions
- Integration tests pass
- Security scan passes (no critical vulnerabilities)
- Code quality checks pass
- Coverage meets minimum threshold

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning but Not Blocking:**
- Performance tests (unless significant regression)
- Security tests (non-critical findings)
- Code quality warnings (non-error level)

### Deployment Environments

1. **Staging**: Automatic deployment on successful CI
2. **Production**: Manual approval required after staging validation

## Artifacts and Reports

### Generated Artifacts

- **Test Results**: JUnit XML files for all test suites
- **Coverage Reports**: HTML, XML, and JSON coverage reports
- **Performance Reports**: Benchmark results and regression analysis
- **Security Reports**: Vulnerability scans and security test results
- **Quality Reports**: Code quality analysis results

### Retention Policies

- **Test Results**: 30 days
- **Coverage Reports**: 30 days
- **Performance History**: 90 days (for trend analysis)
- **Security Reports**: 90 days
- **Deployment Reports**: 90 days

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked

- **Test Execution Time**: Total time for each test suite
- **Coverage Percentage**: Overall and per-module coverage
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Response times, throughput
- **Security Scan Results**: Vulnerability counts and severity
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Percentage of successful deployments

### Trend Analysis

The pipeline maintains historical data for:
- Performance benchmarks over time
- Coverage trends
- Test execution time trends
- Security vulnerability trends

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Coverage Below Threshold
```bash
# Check which files need more coverage
cd tests
python -m pytest --cov=../src --cov-report=html
# Open htmlcov/index.html to see detailed coverage
```

#### 2. Performance Regression
```bash
# Run performance tests locally
cd tests
python -m pytest -m "performance" --benchmark-only
```

#### 3. Integration Test Failures
```bash
# Check service dependencies
docker-compose up postgres redis
# Run integration tests
python -m pytest -m "integration" -v
```

#### 4. Security Scan Issues
```bash
# Run security tools locally
pip install safety bandit
safety check
bandit -r src/
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by setting environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  DEBUG_MODE: 'true'
  VERBOSE_LOGGING: 'true'
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Organization
- Keep unit tests fast (< 1 second each)
- Use appropriate test markers
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Use real services only in integration tests

### 2. Performance Testing
- Establish baseline performance early
- Set realistic regression thresholds
- Monitor trends over time
- Profile slow tests regularly

### 3. Coverage Management
- Aim for high coverage but focus on quality
- Exclude generated files from coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Document any intentionally uncovered code

### 4. Security Testing
- Include security tests in regular runs
- Test authentication and authorization
- Validate input sanitization
- Check for common vulnerabilities

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Weekly**: Review performance trends and coverage reports
2. **Monthly**: Update dependency versions and security tools
3. **Quarterly**: Review and update test thresholds
4. **Annually**: Audit entire pipeline configuration

### Monitoring

- Set up alerts for pipeline failures
- Monitor test execution times
- Track coverage trends
- Review security scan results

## Integration with External Tools
