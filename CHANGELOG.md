    enable_prompt_optimization=True,  # Enable advanced features
    enable_caching=True,
    enable_contextual_retrieval=True,
    vector_store=your_vector_store
)

# Process query with optimization
response = await chain.ainvoke("Which casino is safest for beginners?")
print(f"Answer: {response.answer}")
